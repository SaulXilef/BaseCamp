What are your favourite places that you‚Äôve visited?,"This is probably a weird question to ask in this subreddit, but haven‚Äôt met many Bronxites that love to travel.

I‚Äôd say my favourite cities are Hong Kong, Edinburgh, Sevilla, Moscow, London, and Berlin. Although my knowledge of it is minimal, I‚Äôm a huge fan of architecture and trains.

They started to argue, Then, Taf5 got mad & pushed her into a door. Nokz pulled out a blade on Taf5. Taf5 ran out the house so Nokz told Lil Kay G5 to chase Taf5 with him, Nokz & Lil Kay G5 chased Taf5 up the block until Taf5 called the cops. Nokz & Lil Kay G5 ran back to the house, Taf5 & Nokz became each others opp after that so Taf5 decided to link up with a Bushwick, Evergreen group & create his own gang (G5100) a mixture of GDs & bloods, G5100 has still no crime records. They are made a song called G5K which featured G6 members, Later, The G5100 clicked ties with the G6 members & called it G6100. Old G6100 members still classify as G5100 but new members classify as G6100. The G5 members are still quiet about that topic because it‚Äôs a frustrating loss for them, However, When it‚Äôs mentioned the G5 members usually retaliate saying Taf5 is a snitch for calling police on them but G6100 & G5100 members claim that they didn‚Äôt do any thing to Taf5 when they had a chance",18xboyq,0,5,https://reddit.com/r/bronx/comments/18xboyq/what_is_g5_g5100/,Bronx,1704260196.0,"['what the fuck are you even saying', 'Thanks for sharing', 'Does anybody else smell burnt toast?', 'Ok.

Stolen car epidemic in the Bronx,This is obviously a known thing in the Bronx that most stolen cars in NYC end up in the Bronx. Hunts Point is a very known area where stolen cars end up getting dumped at. Today I took a drive down Hunts point and I seen so many stolen cars. I seen brand new cars with temp tags scratched off vin numbers. My question is why is nobody shining any light on this problem? NYPD knows from their data that Hunts point is known for to hide their stolen cars. Yet NYPD is doing absolutely nothing about this.

To put that in perspective,  Manhattan impounds around 200 cars *a day* on average alone.   They also closed the west side tow pound, compounding things.\n\nThey literally have nowhere to put errant cars so certain areas just get overlooked.\n\nThat's part of it. The biggest part.  The other part is the organizational structure of the NYPD.  Parking enforcement is done by Traffic Enforcement.  Patrol, the cruisers you generally see around the city, are not in that division. They do not see it as their job to get involved with licensing and registration issues unless it is part of an actual call.   This is different than pretty much every department out there due to the NYPD, in actuality, being a multi headed hydra golem that was formed from like 8 different previous police departments of old.

The coalition‚Äôs first priority is closing the jail and ending the suffering of those incarcerated there, most of whom are still awaiting trial. Conditions have deteriorated so much that the federal government may soon take control of the city‚Äôs jails through a process called receivership.  \nIt is unclear how receivership would impact Renewable Rikers, but any delay in closure would impact the already ambitious timeline for the city‚Äôs energy transition.

I've been craving those specific sunflower seeds for a long time.

They sold peppermints, butterscotch candy, almonds, pistachios, etc. 99c star or circle logo in the top right corner, the top \~40% was blue with the brand name, and the back was full blue. On the bottom half the bag was clear.

Any help or pictures would be greatly appreciated.",18hbi8b,4,7,https://reddit.com/r/bronx/comments/18hbi8b/anybody_know_the_brand_of_the_99c_blue_packaged/,Bronx,1702452799.0,"['[Bazzini Nuts](https://www.bazzininuts.com/)?', 'No, they were a very small brand, I think it was (Something) Farms.

Notably shameful recent moments of CB11 include¬†our vice chair‚Äôs op-ed¬†[demeaning our Black neighbors](https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/11/02/bronx-community-board-11-demote-vote/)¬†and recently¬†[heated racist discussions](https://www.bxtimes.com/just-home-public-hearing-chaos/)¬†regarding a new housing project for our formerly incarcerated and unhoused neighbors. District residents speaking in favor of the housing project were met with shouts of ‚Äúanimals‚Äù and accusations of intent to destroy their neighborhood. We‚Äôve seen a ‚Äúfan‚Äù of the Proud Boys run on the GOP line for state Assembly (Gene DeFrancis), not once, but twice within the past five years, and we‚Äôve invited Rudy Guliani into our local parades willingly. The flags are looking red in the Bronx lately, in more ways than one.

CB11 is but one case study of the right wing‚Äôs increasing foothold all across New York City. It‚Äôs not hard to see why, with a mayor spouting bigoted anti-migrant talking points, warning New Yorkers about the arrival of asylum seeking migrants with fear-stoking words:¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to come to your neighborhood. All of us are going to be impacted by this. I said it last year when we had 15,000, I‚Äôm telling you now with 110,000. The city we knew, we‚Äôre about to lose.‚Äù

When our leaders resort to actions such as name calling, corruption and violent rhetoric, as Eric Adams has, we know that real-world violence looms.  . . .  
   . . .  
 I know that I never want to hear my neighbors saying ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt let them take over‚Äù again when I‚Äôm walking down White Plains Road; I want to hear those voices saying ‚Äúwelcome home.‚Äù""

Concentrating poverty didn‚Äôt work with slum clearance and housing projects, and it doesn‚Äôt work now. It seems as they clear certain neighborhoods of their poor/destitute/homeless/mentally ill/unemployed/drug addicted class, somehow a lot of them end up in the Bronx. That‚Äôs by design, not by accident. They did that with drug addicts and AIDS/HIV patients here too in the 80s and 90s. It never ends.', 'I‚Äôm glad you are aware of this. It is quite unfortunate that the Bronx is unfairly carrying the weight of other parts of the city. It can definitely end, starting with more voter turnout and people who really want to make change running for office. \n\nThe Bronx was trending in the right direction entering the 2000s, but has taken a turn for the worse since the deBlasio administration. Adams also is not helping, and neither are politicians like Salamanca, Ayala, and a whole list of others.', ""That is true of the Bronx as a whole - but not of the Community Board 11 district or Council District 13.  Shelters are concentrated in the South and Central Bronx, in Salamanca's and Feliz's districts in particular.  Salamanca and Feliz are both refusing further shelters in their districts.  \nCurrently there are no shelters in Council District 13, although 2 or 3 are under construction.    \nBut Just Home is not a shelter, it is permanent housing for people who will sign leases and pay rent from their income, with subsidies if needed.  And the surrounding area is one of the wealthier in the Bronx."", 'Yes the concentration is heavier in the South and Central Bronx as you say. Salamanca has just recently ‚Äúchanged‚Äù his tune after a fight against a historic church that he worked to tear down to build another supportive housing building in an overburdened area. He actively worked against his constituents.\n\n He is not a great guy, and because politicians like him pushing for this type of housing in the Bronx, people are skeptical of these projects and quite frankly tired of them. It sucks because there are good ones that come along, but all the other bad ones of the past sour the sentiment toward them. \n\nThere is a lot to say, but I am happy these conversations are being had.', ""I'm sure many of the shelters there predate Salamanca, and definitely predate Feliz.  \n\n\nBut shelters are not what the Op Ed is about, are they?"", 'The op-ed isn‚Äôt about that, but it is relevant to the much broader conversation. \n\nSalamanca is a big proponent of shelters and supportive housing in his district, whether they predate him or not. District 17 is number one in the entire city. I have first hand experience with how he operates. He is selling out the Bronx, and that‚Äôs why the residents of the Bronx are weary of these types of housing in communities. One bad apple ruins the bunch.', 'I don‚Äôt think a lot of people are seeing the big picture. You cannot have a borough of entirely neighborhoods where nobody owns anything, everyone is poor, and a large proportion of the population survives on subsidies. People of means do not want to live in a place of contiguous poverty. Sure, perhaps CB 11 doesn‚Äôt face shelters, but the Bronx more than shoulders our fair share of them and is not only the poorest borough, but the poorest county in NYS, and contain some of the poorest communities in the United States.', '100% true. It flies over people‚Äôs heads because it isn‚Äôt said as often as it should. It is seen as NIMBY and right-wing.

But Just Home is not a shelter.', 'Are you seriously comfortable with ex inmates with health and mental illnesses from Rikers living in your neighborhood and on a campus with vulnerable people? The Jacobi campus is not as isolated from the surrounding neighborhood as you make it out to be. It‚Äôs wide open with almost no patrols from the HPD. They barely even do anything inside the facilities when you call them during an emergency. The staff are very upset and worried about this. The majority of the staff are women, most of whom are middle and older aged. They fear for their safety, especially during shift changes late at night and early in the morning.', 'Yes, I am ""seriously"" comfortable with it - because I live in a neighborhood where I know individuals, mostly younger men, who have been released from Rikers, they have even lived in my own apartment building. If they still are committing crimes, they certainly don\'t do it in their own immediate neighborhood.  And I also know people in my neighborhood who have worked at Rikers.  \nThe Just Home residents will be in stable, permanent housing - housing they are at severe risk of losing if they re-offend. Plus they will be medically complex individuals - COPD, on dialysis, etc.   \nWhile I understand the fears you mention, I hope that you and the staff seek out more and better information on the Just Home program that will dispel these fears.', 'We have received all the info we need. Our unions are working to put an end to this. We actually care about our patients and have respect for the neighborhood.', ""But you don't care about your patients who happen to have been formerly incarcerated?  That doesn't sound like the mission of either Health & Hospitals -  or Correctional Health, which became a part of H&H in 2016.  \nIt's not a sign of disrespect to the neighborhood to place a leading supportive permanent housing program nearby, I'm sorry you feel that way.  It's a sign that the neighborhood is stable and rich in resources, to be supporting a program like this (although again, the program is wholly on the grounds of the Jacobi campus and walled off from the neighborhood)."", 'The campus is not ""walled off"" from the community as you keep saying. It is wide open and anyone can walk through it 24/7, with no plans to change that. I\'m sure you will start singing a different tune once you see what this does to property values.', ""It is walled off along Seminole Ave. Entrance is on Pelham Parkway, then a long walk, or from Morris Park Ave at the other end.

Echoes in the Shadows: The Unseen Tides of Bronx Community Board 11,"**Narrator (Alex Martin):** Welcome back, to a saga that continues to unfold within the storied corridors of Bronx Community Board 11. Here, a tapestry of political intrigue and covert maneuverings weaves a narrative as complex and shadowy as any modern-day political thriller. This board, a microcosm of local governance, becomes the stage for a clandestine dance of power and resistance, where every whisper and subtle gesture carries the weight of hidden agendas. As our stories unravel, the venerable walls of this institution bear silent witness to the tides of change, echoing with the secrets of those who navigate its hallowed halls. Join me, Alex Martin, as we delve into this intricate world, peeling back layers of mystery to reveal the true forces at play in a community teetering on the brink of transformative change.

***Chapter 2: The Unseen Disruption***

In the heart of Bronx Community Board 11, amidst the ebb and flow of civic duties and responsibilities, a different kind of drama unfolds, one less conspicuous but equally impactful. Here, Roxanne Delgado and Robert Press, though not holding official board positions, have become prominent figures in their own right casting long shadows over the board's proceedings. They are the disruptors, the voices that rise not in unison with the community's chorus, but often in discordant tones, attempting to steer the narrative in directions that serve their interests.

Delgado and Press, armed with social media platforms and a flair for the dramatic, engage in a campaign of distraction and disruption. They don't just speak; they broadcast, reaching out through YouTube performances and online posts, their messages resonating with a certain segment of the community, while others view them with skepticism.

Their role is dual: on one hand, they claim to represent the unheard voices of the community, and on the other, they are seen as agents of chaos, muddling the board's focus and diverting attention from critical issues. Their influence is like a double-edged sword ‚Äì capable of cutting through silence but also capable of inflicting wounds on the process of constructive community dialogue.

Delgado, once a beacon of activism and community involvement, now wields her influence in a manner that disrupts the very fabric of the board's functionality. Her confrontations, often explosive and charged with emotion, transform meetings into battlegrounds, where the focus shifts from communal betterment to personal agendas. Her approach, while rooted in a desire to represent the unheard, morphs into a campaign of division, fostering an atmosphere of distrust and apprehension among board members and the community alike. Her public perception is one of a divisive figure, whose presence at meetings is marked by disputes and confrontations, leading to a perception of dysfunction within the board. This has the potential to decrease public confidence in the board's ability to address community issues effectively.

Press, a figure marred by past political disappointments, carries with him a cloud of skepticism and bitterness. His journey, punctuated by rejection and disillusionment, shapes his interactions with the board. His voice, once hopeful and aspiring, now echoes with cynicism and doubt. Press challenges the legitimacy of board processes and decisions, suspecting cronyism and favoritism at every turn. This skepticism, while valid in its inception, becomes a barrier to constructive engagement, alienating him from potential allies and collaborators. His journey, marked by a failed run for the Assembly and a long struggle for a position on Community Board 8, has left him with a deep sense of disillusionment. His tenure on Board 8 was fraught with conflict, painting him as a contentious figure, unable to foster collaborative relationships. His behavior, often perceived as erratic by his peers, further impeded the board's efforts to enhance community life. Now at Bronx Community Board 11, Press's skepticism towards the board's operations is palpable. His experiences have transformed him into a figure who is increasingly skeptical of the processes that govern the selection and operation of community boards. His open questioning of the legitimacy of new board members, suspecting cronyism and favoritism, and his challenges to the system he seeks to be part of, mark him as an embittered individual, potentially undermining his own goals.

Delgado and Press, in their respective ways, represent a challenge to the board's effectiveness and its ability to serve the diverse needs of the community. Their roles, while portraying them as advocates for certain segments of the community, also raise questions about the authenticity of their representation and their true intentions in the broader context of community governance. 

Together, Delgado and Press form an unusual duo within the board's dynamics. Their actions, often seen as disruptive and counterproductive, raise crucial questions about the board's ability to function effectively amidst such relentless attempts at disruption. They represent the dilemma of balancing freedom of expression with the need for constructive dialogue and decision-making.

As the board grapples with its agenda, Delgado and Press's interventions often lead to prolonged debates, shifting the spotlight away from consensus-building. Their narrative, while compelling to some, raises questions about the authenticity of their representation and their true intentions in the broader context of community governance.

Their presence, while integral to the democratic process, poses a significant challenge to the board's pursuit of a cohesive and productive path forward. As their narratives intertwine with the board's journey, the question lingers: How can Bronx Community Board 11 navigate these turbulent waters and remain true to its mission of serving the diverse needs of the community? 

The story of Delgado and Press is not just one of individual activism but also a reflection of the complex interplay between personal experiences, community representation, and the challenges of maintaining harmony within a governance body. As the board grapples with these dynamics, the path forward remains uncertain, teetering on the edge of transformation and turmoil.

This unfolding scene at Bronx Community Board 11 is a stark reminder of the delicate balance between freedom of expression and the need for constructive, focused dialogue in community decision-making. It begs the question: How can a community board remain effective and true to its purpose amidst such relentless attempts at disruption? The answer to this may well determine the future course of the board and its ability to genuinely serve the diverse needs of the community it represents.",1864rtt,0,10,https://reddit.com/r/bronx/comments/1864rtt/echoes_in_the_shadows_the_unseen_tides_of_bronx/,Bronx,1701200662.0,"['NY Times has entered the comment section', 'Wait‚Ä¶ what?', 'Wow', 'Gadflies.', 'The juiciness of this writing and this board is unmatched.', 'Spicy.

Challenging the Status Quo in Bronx Community Board 11,"**A Champion Emerges from the Sunshine State, Challenging the Status Quo in Bronx Community Leadership**

In the bustling heart of Bronx Community Board 11, a transformative tale is unfolding, spearheaded by a figure we'll call ""The Floridian."" His emergence isn't just refreshing‚Äîit's a powerful gust of change challenging the status quo in local governance.

The community board, under its present Chairperson, has echoed a monotonous narrative, marked by a leadership style teetering between governance and overreach. This board, once a beacon of community engagement, has increasingly become a bastion where diversity of thought is more a slogan than a practice.

The Floridian, an advocate for transparency and inclusivity, has shone a light on troubling practices under the current Chairperson. Stark contrasts emerge between his vision of open governance and the Chairperson's leadership marred by ethical breaches, including grave privacy violations and the suppression of member participation. These actions represent not just a breach of ethical conduct but a profound betrayal of the trust placed in the board's leadership.

At the heart of The Floridian's concerns is the Chairperson's pattern of stacking board committees with individuals from select civic groups, a practice that creates a monopoly of influence, misaligned with the community's evolving demographics. This approach suggests a narrative that serves a select few, overshadowing the diverse voices of the Bronx.

The Floridian's outsider status and approach to community engagement are striking. He champions principles long overlooked by the current leadership: transparency, open dialogue, and an inclusive process where every voice is valued. His genuine commitment to the community's welfare is often mislabeled as activism, a label intended to marginalize his influence.

But the most concerning aspect is the Chairperson's apparent strategy of maintaining power by aligning the board with individuals from interconnected civic groups. This strategy fails to mirror the community's changing demographics, often focusing on maintaining a status quo that benefits a narrow group, not the broader Bronx community.

The Floridian's emergence is a beacon of hope for a segment of the community feeling increasingly disenfranchised by a board more focused on consolidating power than representing diverse interests. His advocacy is a clarion call to reform not just policies but also the very dynamics of power within the board.

Contrasting the current Chairperson's tenure, marked by a narrow interpretation of community needs and an exclusive governance style, The Floridian stands for an inclusive future. His presence on the board is a reminder that effective governance is not just about managing the present but about embracing a vision that encompasses the future.

As Bronx Community Board 11 stands at a crossroads, the choice is clear: maintain the status quo or embrace the transformative winds of change brought forth by The Floridian. It's time for the board to reflect and decide whether to continue on a path that alienates its constituents or pivot towards a more inclusive, transparent, and ethically sound future.

The Floridian's call for change is not just a challenge to the existing power structure‚Äîit's a roadmap for a board that truly reflects and serves its community. His vision and advocacy represent a new dawn for Bronx Community Board 11, one where every voice matters, and governance is a collective journey, not a solitary quest.

Here, a tapestry of political intrigue and covert maneuverings weaves a narrative as complex and shadowy as any modern-day political thriller. This board, a microcosm of local governance, becomes the stage for a clandestine dance of power and resistance, where every whisper and subtle gesture carries the weight of hidden agendas. As our story unravels, the venerable walls of this institution bear silent witness to the tides of change, echoing with the secrets of those who navigate its hallowed halls. Join me, Alex Martin, as we delve into this intricate world, peeling back layers of mystery to reveal the true forces at play in a community teetering on the brink of transformative change.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So what\'s next?**\n\n\r  \n**Scene 2: The Unseen Disruption**\r  \nIn Bronx Community Board 11, Roxanne Delgado and Robert Press emerge as unconventional influencers. Using social media and public platforms, they challenge the board\'s agenda, creating a dichotomy between their disruptive tactics and the board\'s structured deliberations. Their role in the community\'s narrative is ambiguous ‚Äì are they champions of the unheard or architects of chaos?\n\n**Scene 3: The Web of Influence**\r  \nThe board\'s leadership, entwined with entities like the Neighborhood Initiatives Development Corporation, presents a complex dynamic. This intersection of personal affiliations and public duty raises questions about the impartiality of board decisions. Can the board navigate these intertwined interests while maintaining its commitment to the community?\n\n**Scene 4: Blurring Lines**\r  \nThe Morris Park Community Association and the Van Nest Neighborhood Alliance, transcending their roles as mere participants, emerge as influential forces within the board. This fusion of external interests with the board\'s decision-making process challenges the essence of equitable community representation and governance.\n\n**Scene 5: The Need for Transparency**\r  \nThe complex interplay between influential groups and the board spotlights the critical need for transparency and accountability. This narrative, unfolding within Bronx Community Board 11, serves as a microcosm of governance challenges, questioning the true representation of community voices in decision-making processes.\n\n**Scene 6: The Echo Chamber Effect**\r  \nThe symbiosis between board leadership and civic organizations risks creating an echo chamber, overshadowing the diversity of community perspectives. This potential monoculture within the board\'s governance calls for a vigilant reassessment of its decision-making mechanisms.\n\n**Scene 7: The Call for Vigilance**\r  \nThe unfolding saga at Bronx Community Board 11 underscores the importance of upholding transparency and accountability in community governance. This narrative, extending beyond local confines, emphasizes the need for community engagement and the representation of all voices in governance.\n\n**Scene 8: A Continuing Saga**\r  \nAs we delve deeper into Bronx Community Board 11\'s narrative, it becomes emblematic of broader governance challenges. This story, echoing through various community boards and councils, highlights the continuous journey towards inclusive and representative governance.\n\n**Closing Scene: An Invitation to Reflect**\r  \nThis is ""Voices of Change,"" where every episode brings us closer to the heart of community governance. I\'m Alex Martin, inviting you to join us in the next chapter of this compelling journey, where we delve deeper into the shadows and echoes of Bronx Community Board 11.', 'Mr. Edward Perez has a high opinion of himself.

Finding side work as a seniors social companion,"I‚Äôm 30F, and am looking to provide informal seniors companionship services. I‚Äôm a Canadian citizen (i.e. cannot work as US employee with formal agency) and am living in Manhattan until the spring. 

Back in Canada I was an active hospice volunteer, and volunteered at the hospital, homeless shelter and transitional housing. I also completed an End-of-Life Doula certificate program. My passion is geriatrics and palliative care, and will be applying to medical school in a couple years‚Äô time. 

I just enjoy being around and spending time with seniors: I love their wit, candor, wisdom, and perspective. Since being away from my volunteer and community roles back home, I am missing these interactions. 

Some of the activities I‚Äôd be happy to support:

&#x200B;

* Tech support (I find this very fulfilling): Android/iPhone/iPad/computer/printer/TV/how to use the internet
* Recording life stories/documenting family recipes
* Excursions to museums, lectures and seminars, restaurants, going for neighbourhood walks

If we were to do activities, my ticket/meal would be covered, +$20/hr spent together paid in cash or PayPal. 

Where can I find opportunities or post about my services? I‚Äôm thinking community bulletin boards to start, but would appreciate any leads. Thank you :) ",18yhs58,5,0,https://reddit.com/r/manhattan/comments/18yhs58/finding_side_work_as_a_seniors_social_companion/,Manhattan,1704387263.0,[]

Will the 3 Av El or West Side Hwy ever be Rebuilt?,"The Third Avenue Line of the Interborough Rapid Transit is the most iconic elevated railway in New York City by far because it spans the very heart of New York City and runs above the primary streets, which consists of Midtown East, the Financial District, and the Bowery connecting the two, all of which are located in Manhattan below Central Park. It is arguably the most iconic part of New York City, just like the Loop carrying L trains is to Chicago. Given how decrepit from neglected maintenance the elevated railways in Manhattan were in the early 1950s, it was understandable why it needed to be demolished. The sudden collapse of the West Side Highway in the early 1970s showed how catastrophic the comsequences could have been.

Losing the 3rd Ave El was almost certainly even more major of a loss to the cultural identity of New York than losing the original 1911 headhouse of Pennsylvania Station. Noise with elevated railways built since the mid-1980s is not a problem at all because they use continuously welded rail to eliminate clacking noises outside of switches and use rubber pads to isolate the track from the structure. Such vibration isolators are known as under-sleeper pads and under-tie pads. So, even an elevated railway that is newly built today but with the architecture of a historic metal structure would still be as quiet as a typical contemporary bone-stock automobile driving by at urban thoroughfare speeds. Even if the Third Avenue Elevated Line was rebuilt entirely with high-grade stainless steel but still painted over with the original colour, it would have still almost certainly been multiple times cheaper than tunneling either the Second Avenue Subway or the East Side Access through several miles of very-hard metamorphic schist rock.

So, before year 2101, is there any appreciable chance that New York will build a brand-new 3rd Avenue Elevated Railway with contemporary engineering but with the architectural appearance identical to the original? What do you think the probability is? How about before year 2201? How about the aesthetic West Side Highway?",18oqeun,0,16,https://reddit.com/r/manhattan/comments/18oqeun/will_the_3_av_el_or_west_side_hwy_ever_be_rebuilt/,Manhattan,1703283314.0,"['No. Have you seen how crowded and dark the areas around elevated train tracks and roadways are?', ""That's because they didn't put lighting on the underside of the viaduct.

I am suggesting that they build a new El in the original appearance but engineered to standards that are unimaginably higher for most New Yorkers (but such an example of the contemporary engineering quality exists in NYC which is the JFK Airtrain viaduct made out of a different material).\n\nAs for the filth and nastiness, that's just because the MTA is mismanaged. PATH and the Airtrain systems at both Newark Liberty International and JFK International are much cleaner, smoother, and more reliable than the MTA subway because they are all operated by PANYNJ rather than the MTA. Also, the Patco Speedline in Philadelphia is also another largely elevated good system that is managed by another port authority.

Please do not take this in the wrong way,"Hi, I don't want this taken the wrong way. Let me start by saying may the innocent people who perished that day rest in peace. I have a strong connection to 9/11 as it is my first memory the first thing I can truly remember well. I was only 3 when it happened but I remember it like yesterday. I was wondering if anyone knew about where I would get artifacts/remenants from that day or prior, even disposable photos taken of the event or a observation deck ticket before the event just somethings from the wtc towers. I know it maybe very hard to find such things as most are gone or in a museum and it may also seem strange to want such stuff but I don't mean disrespect by asking this I just would like to own some type of artifact from that day.

In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.', 'Jeez you sound like some kinda physco in America.']"
Coffee Shop for Board games,"Hi all,

Hit & run on Williamsburg bridge - footage,"Hey fam - around 11:00pm tonight I witnessed 2 cars racing, weaving in and out of traffic on the Williamsburg bridge towards Brooklyn. Sure thing, they hit 2 cars and spun out of control, then left the scene. Firstly, I hope everyone involved is ok. Second, I have a video here that hopefully will help. 

If anyone who was involved needs video, please DM me. I don‚Äôt want to post in fear doxxing myself but happy to send to whoever needs it. One car, which I cannot remember the make but was darker in color had PA plates (no video), and the white car had NJ plates. From what I could see, the white car was the one who committed the crime (they spun out of control and were facing traffic then sped off).

Would it be unwise of my to spend $3k/month on rent stabilized unit? $110k income.,"Via the housing lottery, I have the opportunity to move into a new luxury Williamsburg 1-bedroom. It's rent stabilized, for $3k/month. Similar units in the building are at least $4.5k/month.

It's really the perfect location in the heart of Williamsburg, right off the Bedford Ave stop. The unit is spacious and has a balcony.

At the same time, I'm thinking about my friends in VC/finance/tech who make way more than me and are still living with roommates to save up. It's so hard for me to justify spending this much on rent when I'm only 24, but I don't want to have any regrets 5 years for not taking advantage of this.

What would you do in this scenario? Thank you in advance for any thoughts.

Local author book launch - live comedy + live jazz + satire poetry,"Hey all!

I‚Äôm a local indie author and I‚Äôm throwing a launch party for my new book of satire poetry called Deep & Original Thoughts! It will be at Uck Billy right next to McCarren Park on Jan 20th from 8pm-12am.

We have the SHC Collection, a local jazz band, performing as the house band as well as some local NYC comedians. We will also have a bar, $4 beers and $8 cocktails. There will also be an upstairs smoking section.

Tickets will come with a signed copy of the book which has 100 poems complimented by 100 illustrations. Think Milk & Honey, but, satire.

Truly hope you can make it out, I‚Äôve put the Eventbrite link below‚Äî

Neighborhood Recs for late 20s Transplant,"Before I sign a one year lease in Bushwick, I'm wondering if it's a good fit. I found several good options around Brooklyn in my budget so it's not a matter of practicalities or commute since I work remotely. 

* mid to late 20s woman (single) first time living in NYC- not first time in a big city
*  I like going out but for a big party/late night probably once a month otherwise I prefer low key
* Not super picky just want a place that's relatively safe and where I feel like part of community. I'll probably join a dance class and an art/book club. I also like learning languages and normally spend a few hours a week volunteering for different causes. 
* My tastes overlap with hipsters but I don't vibe with the too cool/pretentious vibe some hipsters have. This is my main concern with Bushwick. 

What neighborhood would you recommend? Thanks in advance!

The same goes for general retail stores and even shopping malls. Owners are generally much better there than in NYC at training and controlling their dogs, which is probably why it works okay for them to be allowed more broadly. Additionally the authorities there take this kind of misbehavior seriously, and it‚Äôs often even required to have pet liability insurance in case your dog injures someone or damages their property. (They also have legally mandatory rules for the dog‚Äôs welfare, such as making sure it‚Äôs not in a cage all the time.)\n\nEven in Germany, dogs (except for service dogs) are not allowed in supermarkets.\n\n(Why am I in a Brooklyn subreddit if I‚Äôm discussing Germany? I grew up in Brooklyn, have lived there most of my life, and expect to be moving back there within the next couple of months. Germany is just a noteworthy comparison on this point.)', 'I\'ve read that dogs are socialized differently outside of the US; thanks for the first-hand perspective. \n\nI simply wish more dog owners would think about other people who are afraid of or allergic to dogs instead of the ""anyone who doesn\'t like dogs is trash"" mantra.', '> I\'ve read that dogs are socialized differently outside of the US; thanks for the first-hand perspective.\n\nOh it\'s not that dogs are necessarily better behaved everywhere outside the US - Germany is much more dog-friendly than countries like Canada or Mexico or the UK or France, with generally better-trained dogs and better-behaved owners as well.\n\nAnd I don\'t mean to imply that misbehavior never happens or always gets punished, even in Germany. Of course not. But still, the magnitude of the problem is very much lower there than in NYC.\n\n> I simply wish more dog owners would think about other people who are afraid of or allergic to dogs instead of the ""anyone who doesn\'t like dogs is trash"" mantra.\n\nCompletely agreed. Respecting people with different needs or desires is important, as is providing enough opportunities to shop or dine away from dogs.\n\nSimilarly, I wish people who dislike dogs would realize that pets are often emotionally almost as much a part of the family as human babies, who are pretty much always allowed in every store and restaurant, and who can often cry and disrupt other patrons more than those pet dogs which are on the calmer, more well-behaved end of the spectrum. (I realize this analogy doesn\'t extend to allergies, of course.)\n\nMy comparison to babies is not saying that pets necessarily need to be allowed everywhere babies are. Certainly not. Even in Germany there are many stores and restaurants that choose not to allow pets without any applicable legal requirement; as a dog owner, I do respect and follow those rules.\n\nAnd similarly, I realize NYC hasn\'t yet gotten the owners to train their pets well enough to make it sufficiently safe and hygienic to allow them more broadly, nor have most New Yorkers yet been convinced that such a policy is even viable to the level I\'ve seen in Germany. All of that is reason for dog owners in NYC to respect the rules in NYC.\n\nSo, yeah, the people who don\'t like dogs around can quite legitimately be mad at dog owners who feel entitled to ignore the rules, at least aside from those stores and restaurants which explicitly go out of their way to be dog friendly despite the rules, in which case their anger should go to the store owner or management instead.\n\nBut people who want dog-free shopping and dining should respect the validity of the desire of dog owners for a different set of laws and regulations, so that some stores and restaurants could legally choose to allow dogs while others don\'t. They should realize that people who want a change in the law can still respect the current laws.', '[deleted]', ""And that is one reason we don't allow animals in certain establishments.

Regarding Sunset Park outskirts (including industry city),"For some background, I‚Äôm an avid bicyclist in Brooklyn, and I don‚Äôt live here anymore but I come back to visit family. Every time I visit, I make at least one trip by bike from south Brooklyn (think Brighton beach, Marine park) to downtown brooklyn (red hook, brooklyn heights, dumbo, Williamsburg) and I only really discovered the existence of IC about two years ago. It‚Äôs become my go to chill spot with friends because of the awesome public areas to sit at and the food spots. Today, I took such a ride but decided to focus a little more on the outer parts of sunset park. Like around the army terminal, down 1st ave, to industry city. My question is - what in the world is going on with all of the broken piers, buildings, and the general existence of bush piers terminal park?? For starters, that park is awesome. Pretty clean, tiny woodsy walk with a Manhattan view, and water fountains. It‚Äôs so hidden behind those scrappy buildings that look like a Team Fortress 2 map. I understand it‚Äôs not gonna turn into a whole mall/food court, but all of the warehouses around it are straight up off putting, would never guess there‚Äôs a park there. Then, the general atmosphere of the broken infrastructure. There‚Äôs obviously a ton of business that goes on there, shipping, manufacturing etc. and I‚Äôm not saying NYC shouldn‚Äôt have space for that but a majority of the buildings are obviously unoccupied and walled off from any access. Why? Is the city actively suppressing reconstruction there? It seems like decent opportunities for more jobs and economic development. I watched a short news clip about IC getting a big NO from the city about their request to expand, citing that the project would supercharge gentrification. I don‚Äôt disagree with that. Why hasn‚Äôt anybody, among the millionaire and billionaire residents attempted anything else with those buildings? For example, a hydroponics setup..? Grow fresh food within the city?? Seriously, most of 1st avenue between the army terminal and industry city looks like somewhere Batman would find the Joker and Bane purchasing a nuclear warhead.

Thoughts,"I am from upstate and love going to the city to hang out and go to galleries and meet up with friends. 

I am in my late 20s and have thought about moving to the city a few times and almost had an opportunity but nervous and no plans for things. Since all I know is living at home.
For me I want a plan of the first few weeks or so I know plans don‚Äôt always work out but just so I know what I am doing and where to go for things.

The rent in the city is crazy specially for a shoebox or an illegal apartment but I am an artist that needs space. 

So what I wanted to ask is do you think the rents will go down in the city to where it‚Äôs affordable for young artists or am I SOL.

Another thing to add is a friend of a friend was looking for a place near me but found a 2br apartment in the city for cheaper then a 1br here which is crazy. 

Also I been applying to a ton of art jobs down there and they want 4+ years of art school. Plus for it to be worth it for me to find something part time down there has to be 30+ an hour, idk how people live in the city for 15/hour. Idk just thinking and ranting

Jackson Heights move,"Hey all,

Me and my partner are moving to Queens, for work and school. I am going to CUNY Law  for public interest/immigration/refugee law and she is going to be working in Midtown. I am checking out neighborhoods in Queens since they are in our price range and our commute, with a big focus on walkability.  I am familiar with Manhattan and Brooklyn as I have had family who lived there, But know Jackson Heights fits much more what we want. My partner is South Asian but I am white, and I miss my home city which was much more diverse than where I live now. Do all cultures mend together in the community, and does it have a communal feel in general ? We are looking to stay in the area for the long run. Also how does safety compare to somewhere like Astoria (Which is a bit out of our range) I grew up in public housing so am not worried about safety, but she grew up in the burbs and I want to make sure it'd be safe for a woman.

Moving to Queens from Miami!,"Hi all! This is my first post on Reddit! 

I‚Äôm currently planning a move from Miami to Queens and could use any help I can get from those of you that have made a major move like this. 

The original plan was to just drive up with whatever I can fit in my car and figure out the rest there but thats proving difficult so now I‚Äôm looking at shipping my car and hiring movers. 

The issue I‚Äôm coming across is that I actually don‚Äôt have a lot to move so I feel like the costs I‚Äôm being quoted aren‚Äôt worth it. I‚Äôm only moving my clothing & shoes, queen bed, nightstands, & glassware/kitchenware. Have you used other options like shipping containers or something I haven‚Äôt considered?

Since then, they‚Äôve moved to Northern Blvd. Between 73rd & 74th Streets. 
They‚Äôre still serving up the same delicious homemade Italian dishes we all grew up loving and the owners are still ever present to greet every guest with a warm smile & an unmatched hospitality that truly makes you feel at home!! 
For one night only, they have partnered up with Grapevine Merchants (another Jackson Heights native importing and distributing fine artesanal wine from all over the world since 2007) to offer a delicious start to the New Year:
Four courses consisting of options of their fan-favorite Italian dishes & four glasses of fine Italian wine to perfectly pair with the dishes from Venice Italy (Ponte 1948) for only $75/ per person and this all includes a discussion on each wine as well!

Looking at potentially living in Kew Gardens but wondering what the commute to Manhattan would be like by bike and train on rainy days.,18w8pa6,12,20,https://reddit.com/r/Queens/comments/18w8pa6/bike_commute_from_kew_gardens_to_manhattan/,Queens,1704148134.0,"['By bike it depends how close you are to queens Blvd, it‚Äôs about 45-50 minutes to Manhattan down queens blvd, and a street called skillman.  It‚Äôs nearly all bike lane, it‚Äôs an easy ride until the queensboro bridge climb which isn‚Äôt that bad.\n\nThe annoying part about bike commuting is where you lock your bike, so there‚Äôs always citi bike but that has its own issues.', 'I commuted 3-5 days a week by bike from Kew Gardens to Queensboro bridge for about a year, takes 35-40 min depending on my mood and the weather so just about 10-20 minutes short of your intended commute. It‚Äôs not a difficult ride, a couple of nice hills to push up against when going towards Manhattan, the wind can be a pain in the ass in the colder seasons, but overall I really enjoyed it. \n\nBig caveat was always having music and podcasts to listen to, the long ride can be a drag without some entertainment in your ear. Pretty safe overall too, all bike lanes, but you need to always be vigilant for mofos in cars making illegal turns in and out of the service road/bike lane, there‚Äôs absolutely no police enforcement.\n\nE/F trains are always available as a cop out on days where you‚Äôre not feeling it or the weather sucks, I‚Äôd bike and lock up at the train, had one attempted theft but they didn‚Äôt seal the deal. I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable leaving my bike if it was worth more than $500. \n\nHope this helps, I‚Äôd be happy to answer any other questions you have about the ride.', ""It's worth noting that they will be redesigning Queens Boulevard in a few years. The bike lanes will be moved onto the median. I'm not certain how the construction will affect the lanes while ongoing.\n\nhttps://nycdotprojects.info/project-updates/presentation-now-available-0"", ""I bike from Jackson Heights everyday, not Kew. It's really pleasant, all bike lanes and enough of a push on Queensboro that you're getting a workout but not so much, you're wiped out. I use citibike so I can trade off with the subway if bad weather, drinking. Takes me 45 min to midtown. The hardest part is going from midtown bike lane to midtown destination. Queens is easy as long as you have a high vis. I've had 2 instances of bad weather this winter so far."", 'It‚Äôs is very possible to bike to the city from Kew Gardens. Queens Blvd would be the primary bike lane. This year it was expanded even more into Queens to Kew Gardens. If you can find housing close to Queens Blvd it‚Äôs also along where the subway runs. \n\nI regularly commute by bike from north eastern Queens and it takes me about 15 minutes to get to Queens Blvd and then about 30 minutes to get to the city. \n\nI have access to secure bike storage. Depending on what you‚Äôre riding / where you‚Äôre going this could be a factor. You could look into ooneepod which provides free secure bike parking but they have limited locations atm.\n\nQueens Blvd bike lane is a mixed bag. Some parts are hardened but some parts are very hairy (Union Turnpike), overall decent. Skillman which takes you to the queensboro bridge is quite nice.', 'If you‚Äôre commuting to midtown anywhere close to Penn Station or Grand Central, look into the LIRR. Sure, you pay extra for the service but getting to midtown from KG in under 20 minutes on a reliable schedule can be priceless if it works for your destination.', 'The LIRR from Kew Gardens isn‚Äôt very cost prohibitive in my opinion. It‚Äôs $183 for monthly pass, which comes out to less than $5 per ride if commuting both ways 5x per week.', 'More expensive but not cost prohibitive, I agree. \n\nIf you work near those terminals it‚Äôs honestly a dream commute. I had Forest Hills to Penn for an office on 7th Ave & 30th for about 5 years and you can‚Äôt beat it.', 'Exactly, the time savings is worth it. \n\nFH to Penn on the E is like 45 mins during rush hour. It‚Äôs less than 20 on the LIRR so you save hours per week doing it that way.', 'Maybe it‚Äôs 45 minutes on the E train from Forest Hills to 42nd Street if there‚Äôs a delay. \n\nNow that the subway signal system is almost totally upgraded, travel time to 42nd Street is more like 27 to 30 minutes. It would be even faster if it wasn‚Äôt for the C train merge at 50th Street.', '100%, if you‚Äôre commuting to midtown. It‚Äôs really convenient if not just for the consistency every morning. Plus, it tends to be faster and cleaner too.\n\nThe trouble is that commuting 5x week isn‚Äôt as common.', ""A friend of mine does it almost every day. It's doable, although it's a bit on the long side. Would be much faster if you were in Astoria/LIC."", 'The bike lane down queens blvd is pretty much terrifying.', 'Been doored on Queens Blvd‚Ä¶ guy parked in the bike lane.', 'This is my worry as someone who just wants to try biking there for fun.', ""Subway is good; about 30 mins to 42nd Street by express E/F train.  LIRR is available; faster, but more costly - probably standing room only at peak times.\n\nI haven't biked to Manhattan in over ten years, but it was rough then.  There are bike lanes now, but I don't think they're much safer.  I had two very painful accidents"", 'Queens blvd has a bike lane that goes all the way to Manhattan from Kew Gardens I believe', ""Bike lane is great and regularly improving with more barriers; it's still plagued by cars parking in it and a few strips without protection, but it is an improvement over no lanes and makes for a direct line all the way to sunnyside, at which point you can shift over to the bike lane on Skillman two or three blocks to the north. Crossing the train rails at Sunnyside Yards is lousy and the Queensboro bridge is narrow with lots of motorized vehicles that shouldn't be there taking up space and zipping by, but it's manageable.  50 minutes into midtown manhattan sounds about right depending on traffic. Lots of places to hop on the train along the route if for any reason the ride isn't for you that day. From Kew Gardens/Union Turnpike to 53rd street in manhattan is between 20 and 35 minutes depending on train traffic. I've locked bikes in midtown for years and had a few issues but nothing crazy; I recommend bike insurance (I use velosurance and have spent enough for a new bike over the past 10 years) if that's a concern.   \n\n\nCome join us. The best way to keep cars out of the bike lanes is to keep them filled with cyclists!"", 'Take the train like a normal person', 'Forget biking to the city. It‚Äôs not realistic']"

So here\'s my long comment on Bayside or Forest Hills (without further ado, lol). They\'re both quiet (and generally family-friendly) neighborhoods, but apart from that, they\'re very different.\n\nForest Hills is urban-suburban mixed neighborhood, though mostly urban (south of the LIRR is suburban-like with a lot of houses). Generally speaking, FH is more dense and more bustling (Austin st has a lot of restaurants (diverse ones)/bars and clothing shops, and Forest Hills Stadium is just a walk down 71st ave, but also a lot to do on Metropolitan ave). There\'s more transportation options in FH (LIRR, MTA subway, buses, plus the big bike lane along Queens Blvd) and is for the most part walkable, at least around Austin St and Queens Blvd. Going south of FH towards Metropolitan ave can be a long walk, depending on how far you go since no subways run around those parts.\n\nBayside is mostly suburban (or ""suburban-like"" for a lack of better word). It\'s more quieter, less dense, a lot more family houses (of course many apartments in Bayside). There aren\'t that much transportation options in Bayside apart from the Port Washington LIRR and some buses, but it isn\'t very walkable unless you\'re fine with transferring between buses (and waiting long) and walking long distances. Most people here drive, though some people also take bike/escooter. There are plenty of restaurants and bars, but it\'s mostly on Bell blvd, with the rest along Northern Blvd mostly being Korean restaurants. There are also diverse restaurants on Francis Lewis Blvd, but you either have to drive there or wait for and take bus to get there, which can be inconvenient.\n\nSo all in all, they\'re both quiet neighborhoods with a lot of things to do, but it all really depends on your needs, priorities, etc.  FH has more transportation options and more activity while Bayside is more residential (quieter and less dense).', 'Bayside', 'Forest Hills.

In the middle of the night, I found this Reddit conversation in my email.  I am sorry each one of you are going through this awful experience.  Reading your experiences has brought back memories of my former living condition infested with several kinds of cock roaches.  I used to have the American roach, the aggressive German roach, and some weird white albino roaches.  They all lived together and invaded my apt after a new family had moved in underneath my former apt.  All those roaches stopped as soon as that family moved out too.  It is true what you are saying....the home base cock roach nest is in one of your neighbors apts.  And those roaches are traveling through their roach tunnels spreading out looking for food.  The building Supers knows who is doing what in their building.  The Supers need to tell the Landlord and the Landlords must force that negligent neighbor to allow them to enter that apt to eradicate the cock roaches.  This is a health hazard threat to everyone in the building and that negligent neighbor is acting like an undesirable tenant if they continue to fail to cooperate.  The Landlord is ultimately responsible concerning this health hazardous problem and should take all steps including eviction proceedings for undesirable tenant if needed.\nMy NYC apt situation today is not with infestation of cock roaches but with drug addict(s) smoking that illegal designer drug K2 in the building.  It stinks very bad here like a dangerous pungent toxic chemical cocktail that it is. And cigarette smokers inside building too.  This is a no smoking building and this chronic building violation harms the health of others here who are battling life threatening health diagnosis.  The Landlord does not do enough and allows problem to continue and even rewards this hostile life threatening behavior with new lease renewals giving a green light for undesirable behavior to continue to harm the health if the rest of us.  The landlords act afraid of drug addicts.  Many neighbors have moved out away from this and new people are moving into this.  \nI been feeling sad for my living situation here in NYC.  When I read what you all are going through with the cock roach infestation, it brought horrible memories back and given a choice, I now feel better living next door to my drugging smelly neighbors.

Making sure I open every closet, seal off any vents so the smoke stays in. I use diatomaceous earth, sprinkle it where the floor meets the wall. A tiny hole? Fill it with the powder. In the cabinets, in the closets.  Then I go around and pull every appliance away from the wall and go through the whole apartment with caulk. The corners gets sealed, the areas around outlets, the baseboards get sealed, under the sinks, around the door frames. Every place that looks like dirt can get in, I seal it. Then sprinkle a little of the earth again behind the appliances and under the sinks and we good to go. My next door neighbor was a senior lady that always had the exterminator over, but we never had to call them. \n\nI loved the places I lived in and my current place. I don't want to lose my great apartment to those fucking roaches."", 'I just had a bad roach problem. But Got rid of it, ill share how. \n\nTo start , I lived in my apartment for 2 years without seeing roaches. I will say I‚Äôm pretty clean, like every once in a while I leave dishes in the sink overnight but that‚Äôs about it. I clean my apartment for about 30-45 mins a day , each day when I get home from work & do a full bleach down of my fridge, kitchen, and tub on Sundays. \n\nSometime in Oct I started seeing a roach or two every couple days at night in my kitchen. I called the super and they sprayed. Seemed to help at first but overall Didn‚Äôt help. Nov came around and I began to see roaches almost every night. It freaked me out so I started cleaning a lot more heavily, pushing up to an hour a day and no food out or dishes ever. Called the super and they came and sprayed again. By December; it was an all out issue. Seeing Roaches every single time I set foot in my kitchen, and tons of babies. Had to even toss my coffee machine. It was the last straw for me. I bought 100$ worth of roach shit off Amazon and kept my kitchen pristine- didn‚Äôt help. \n\nSo I emailed the property management and I told them if they don‚Äôt do something serious about it then I‚Äôm moving out in January. \n\nThey called ‚Äúglobal pest control‚Äù and this company apparently needed to do 2 special cleanings, each one week apart from each other. Every thing had to be emptied out the kitchen or wherever the roaches were. The man came and spent almost 2 hours in my kitchen laying baits and traps and sprays and gels and hosing the whole kitchen down with a chemical from a tank. The man also noted that the stuff on Amazon is fake, made by fake dealers, and does not work. He also noted that the regular spray that the apartments do will only kill the adult roaches that come into contact with the fumes. it does not kill the adults that don‚Äôt, the babies, or nest. \n\nAfter he left, I stuffed ‚Äústeel wool‚Äù into every nook and cranny and hole I could fit it into. After stuffing all the crevices with steel wool, I took silicone and caulked up every cabinet, floor molding, and holes I could find. \nI also ordered a container set for every single food item I have, not a single food can be eaten without unlocking an airtight container (sugar, potatoes, onions, fruits, flour, every single thing is in a container even if it naturally comes in a bag on its own)\n\nLiterally I have not seen a single roach since the first cleaning. I haven‚Äôt had them back for the second cleaning because of the holidays but honestly I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll need it. I went from seeing a herd of roaches every night to nothing. \n\nTotally recommend.', 'The problem is you are in an old big building. Even if you get your own house in order they are likely all over the building. Really no way to fix this unless the entire building goes all in. Sorry', 'I‚Äôve gotten rid of an infestation where I would wake up in the middle of the night to 5-10 roaches in my kitchen. This is maintenance work in between the exterminators\n\nHeres what I did‚Ä¶\n\n3 phase plan\n\n1. Wipe down all surfaces and remove clutter (they love to hide in crevices!) empty out cabinets and spray surfaces with 32oz spray bottle. 1/4 cup vinegar - remaining with water. It will smell at first but let that settle in for a couple of days, then wipe it all clean with pine  sol.\n\n\n2. get the building super to use foam to clog up all the holes and any crevices in and around bathrooms (toilet, cabinet, plumbing), kitchens (cabinets, plumbing), around apartment. They love moisture, and dark spaces.\n\nThis requires you to do some serious investigative work to identify:\n\n- Where they could be coming from \n- where they are ‚Äúhanging out‚Äù \n\nTip: even a 1mm space between the cabinet and the wall is a great place for them to hide\n\n3. CRUCIAL. \nI used Gentrol EVERY night for first week. \nThen every other night for 1 week. \nTHEN once a week.\nNow, bi weekly\n\nGentrol stops them from procreating. You‚Äôll know it‚Äôs working when you start seeing adolescent roaches looking deformed.\n\nIt‚Äôs a foam so I make sure to spray it generously in all those areas where I believe they‚Äôre coming from.\n\nAfter 3 months of infestation, we‚Äôve been roach free for about 6+ months now. It‚Äôs annoying, but it‚Äôs NYC. There are neighbors who are filthy and don‚Äôt care about the well being of their living spaces, let alone others.\n\nLink to Gentrol: https://amzn.to/3RNEDBM\n\nI‚Äôm on my second canister and I spray very sparingly now, bi-weekly as maintenance along with making sure the exterminator sprays and he perimeter of every room, always.\n\n\nLastly, I spray pine sol on my kitchen sink randomly to prevent them from coming up the drain\n\nHope this helps someone!', 'This is amazing! I think they are in the broiler of the stove. But I can‚Äôt find a cluster or nest. And it‚Äôs also hard to get in there to check. Thank you for this and congrats on all that hard work! It really takes a lot of work to maintain these old prewar apts.']"

What are considered some of the best schools in Queens?,"Hello!

I realize the question is a bit silly since I doubt there are any parents out there who wants their kids to go to a bad school. But as my kid is getting closer to starting Kindergarten and we are outgrowing our apartment, I would love to find some thoughts on schools. We live in Astoria and so far the public schools around here hasn‚Äôt felt amazing - at least not given what we pay in rent. But then again I havent been able find good sources.

My kid is timid and very smart. She is calm and contemplative. No social issues but other kids tend to push her over. I want schools that does not foster bullying, that teaches kids writing reading and math over screens. Basically a kind, disciplined school with a great community of parents.

I see tons of cars going 35ish in a 25 speed camera zone clearly labeled every day, but my friends say you must be at 25 or lower or you‚Äôll get a ticket for sure.",18v5ma1,0,19,https://reddit.com/r/Queens/comments/18v5ma1/rules_of_the_road/,Queens,1704020810.0,"[""The speed cameras don't give you a ticket unless you're 10 over the speed limit (max 34 to avoid a ticket). But, I'll generally go no faster than 30 just to be safe. Certain corridors like Queens Blvd and Woodhaven Blvd have them on the entire route, but other roads will just have random ones at certain intersections. Overall though pretty hard to avoid and just easier to go no more than 30-32 max everywhere."", '33mph and over will get you a ticket.', 'No he‚Äôs right I only get tickets at 36', 'can confirm i got 1 at 37 never at 34', 'A couple of newer laws most drivers don‚Äôt know yet:\n\n1. Bicyclists are allowed to follow the pedestrian signal. That means if there is a WALK sign but the traffic light is red, cyclists are allowed to go. It‚Äôs safer for cyclists to get out ahead of traffic rather than compete with it. \n\n2. Drivers and cyclists must stop at any intersection in the presence of a pedestrian trying to cross, even if there is no crosswalk. (Most intersections in the outer boroughs don‚Äôt have crosswalks and pedestrians are not expected to walk a quarter-mile to find a crosswalk to cross the street.)', 'Obey the speed limit. Yield to pedestrians and cyclists, even if you think they‚Äôre doing something illegal. That doesn‚Äôt give you the right to endanger their lives. Drive like you‚Äôre operating a dangerous piece of heavy machinery and can‚Äôt see very well. You are and you can‚Äôt.', ""My personal rule (and the law) is to use the freaking turn signal.\n\nSometimes the signs suck and Google doesn't help and we need to change lanes quickly. Sometimes people are just entitled assholes and try to cut ahead in a long merge line (also, don't do this, it's a douche move). If someone signals that they need into my lane I will always let them in. If they just rudely try to inch in, I will literally crash before letting them in. Don't be entitled, nobody is special. \n\nDon't double park beside a legit parking spot. I've never understood this and it drives me absolutely bananas."", '1. No Turns on Red unless specifically posted otherwise.\n\n2. Red light cameras are real ‚Äî DON‚ÄôT BLOCK THE BOX. Don‚Äôt be that jerk who blocks the crosswalk either because you thought you could make it through the light but couldn‚Äôt.\n\n3. Speed cameras are supposed to be calibrated to 10mph over the speed limit; BUT they can be incorrect, and so can your speedometer. There isn‚Äôt grace for those either; if it accidentally gives you a ticket for 6mph over, you still have to pay.\n\n3.a. Speed limits in the city may vary ‚Äî some highway frontage roads may be 30 mph, and even more common, some school zones and even whole neighborhoods may have 15-20mph limits. This can result in camera tickets starting at 26~mph on certain local/residential streets, but most are supposed to be calibrated to ~35mph.\n\n4. Bus lanes and buses themselves overwhelmingly have ticketing cameras now. They can currently issue tickets for stopping in bus lanes, and coming this year, they‚Äôll issue tickets for obstructing bus stops, bike lanes, and possibly double-parking.\n\n4.a. You can turn right from most bus lanes, as long as you have your blinker activated the entire time you‚Äôre crossing the bus lane, aren‚Äôt in the bus lane for an excessive distance (no more than half a block usually, and there‚Äôs usually a dashed line to indicate legal entrance to the bus lane for turning), and don‚Äôt stop to pick-up or drop-off anyone.\n\n4.b. Some corridors are now busways, including Flushing Main St, Manhattan 14th St, and Downtown BK Livingston St. Certain blocks may restrict vehicle access or require you to turn off the corridor as soon as you can. Livingston only allows travel in 1-direction for everyone except buses and emergency vehicles, for example. These corridors also issue camera tickets.\n\n5. Where bike lanes mix with a turn lane, bikes have the right-of-way, as do pedestrians. Check your mirrors and don‚Äôt block the bike lane or crosswalk until bikes/pedestrians have crossed.\n\n6. Try to let folks zipper merge (take turns) if 2+ lanes drop to 1 lane.\n\n7. As someone stated above, bikes are allowed to go with the walk signal, so a lot of folks complaining about bikes running reds is a lack of knowledge of the updated law. (Some bikes and cars are still jerks and run red lights anyways, but they‚Äôre a minority). There are also dedicated signals for bikes which may differ from the signals for cars at some intersections. \n\n8. Don‚Äôt try to rush. There will be traffic, there will be pedestrians, and there will be aggressive drivers trying to whip around you. Let it go. It‚Äôs better to take it slow and not ruin your day.\n\n9. Always be checking your mirrors and blind spots, especially around bike lanes. You don‚Äôt want to accidentally injure or kill a bicyclist while opening a door or taking a turn too fast to stop!', 'Give cyclists and pedestrians space', 'The bus lanes will ticket you as well.', ""To add to what others have said: here's a link from NYC dot gov about speed cameras now operating 24/7 since August 2022: https://www.nyc.gov/site/finance/vehicles/school-zone-camera-violations.page\n\nI have heard that if you're within 10 mph you're supposed to be okay but one guy I know got a speeding ticket even when he claimed he was within 10 mph of 25 (he may have been in a school zone with a 20 mph speed limit and was driving more than 10mph above that)."", 'You must go the millisecond the light turns green otherwise you will be furiously honked at', 'No right on red within city limits unless specifically posted.\n\nSpeed cameras will absolutely nail you if you exceed posted speed limits - they don\'t care about the theoretical ""ten miles over"" rule we generally assume human cops will allow.\n\nYour horn is your voice, and we talk to each other with our car horns all the time.

Quiet Queens?,"Hi all! I have a general question to ask, forgive me if it‚Äôs been asked before! We are looking for a quieter area to live in, and would love your input.

My husband and I currently live in Brooklyn and have neighbors from hell who blast music excessively, and are also nasty and vindictive (we call 311 on them, they make false claims to the cops and DEP about our dog barking‚Ä¶super fun!) anyway, we are looking to move to Queens because of this, and we are really looking for a quiet neighborhood. 

We are both in our mid 30‚Äôs, he works a hybrid model and I‚Äôm in my first year of grad school. Being in a ‚Äúcool‚Äù part of Queens doesn‚Äôt matter to us, but we‚Äôd love to have like, a coffee shop or neighborhood bar/restaurant to be able to go to every once and a while. We know neighbors from hell can live anywhere, but we are really looking for a neighborhood where slower-paced is kinda the vibe. (We don‚Äôt mind city noise at all - it‚Äôs the non-civility of our neighbors playing the music that we can‚Äôt stand). We DO love to go out (hence why we‚Äôre looking into Astoria), but it‚Äôs not important to live super close to really busy areas.

We‚Äôre looking in Astoria (he lived there previously and LOVED it), Woodside, Sunnyside, Ridgewood, Jackson Heights, and Forrest Hills. 2 bed, $3200/month. Any suggestions on where‚Äôs the best/what part of these areas to look in?

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: we also have a dog and cat, will provide pictures for tax if wanted üòä

ALSO EDIT: ‚Äúslower paced‚Äù probably isn‚Äôt the right wording.

Obtaining a 911 Call Record,"Full story (skip to the question if you don't feel like reading it): 

Last week I got into a car accident right off the Whitestone bridge on the Queens side. Me and the other person called 911 several times and no one showed up, we even went to the local department and we were told that they no longer write accidents police reports at the department and it had to be done at the accident location. 
The accident happened on my way to take a test that I paid for, and the agency is giving me hard time to reschedule it since I technically don't have documented evidence that the accident actually happened. Since I am the one at fault, I am not filing any claims. I honestly don't want to pay for the test again since I have to fix my car out of my pocket.

Question: 
How do I get a record/transcript of my 911 call? What is the process and how long does it take? What local agency should I contact? 

FYI: When the call was made I was told to contact  the 109th precinct (and that's where we went eventually to try and get the report).",18shf3u,9,10,https://reddit.com/r/Queens/comments/18shf3u/obtaining_a_911_call_record/,Queens,1703727083.0,"['The only way to get cops to an accident quickly is to lie and say someone is injured.

Why is there no express bus to Brookyln and how can we make this happen?,"And while we're at it, why are there no express buses to Jersey City? The only bus to any part of Jersey is a very infrequent and slow local bus that stops at Bayonne.

I've already accepted that we're never getting a new train line, a new ferry terminal, bike share (lmao remember lime), hudson bergen light rail extension, or anything.

The issue is, these malls or shopping areas have established foot traffic and crowds. *You can‚Äôt jump in the ring if you don‚Äôt know how to box.* They need customers for a while before they can really start sprinkling in some costs, like parking. Especially, because the Staten Island Mall has free parking plus 100s of stores to attract people to shop at, before they go to the Empire Outlets.

Looking for information on the New York City Farm Colony,"This is my first post on the subreddit, so greetings! I am looking for information on the New York City Farm Colony and its current status. I am a descendant of the original land owners prior to the sale to Richmond County, and I'm looking for information on the property, and whether or not it still has plans to be re-developed, or if those fell though (again). I live in Florida, but I want to see if it's feasible to visit the property to see the current state it is in. The last update I saw was from August 2022.

Based on what I can find, the original 96-acre farm has shrunk to about 43 acres, half its original size, due to dividing the land into smaller parcels to develop baseball fields and add to the Greenbelt. I'm an environmentalist myself, so I support keeping the original farm and land as ""green"" as possible.

It makes me sad to see the current state of the 43 acres; I do hope that it gets repurposed one day. I would also like to know why the property has been in limbo since the facility was closed in 1975, which means that the property has been abandoned, overgrown, and mouldering for almost 50 years now.",17ye5ip,11,3,https://reddit.com/r/statenisland/comments/17ye5ip/looking_for_information_on_the_new_york_city_farm/,statenisland,1700336328.0,"['1.

It will probably happen in the next 10-15 years.', 'Thank you for your reply! It\'s interesting to see how politics comes into play here.\n\nThe most recent news I saw about redeveloping the property also included the preservation and restoration of the original structures and pre-existing farm colony buildings on the property to convert them into residential housing. One source also states that ""landmarked buildings must be restored"", so I don\'t think that waiting for the structures to collapse will revoke the property\'s landmark status at this point. Developers must restore some buildings.\n\nPer the source, Mike Stensland of Pepper Construction:\n\n>""When it\'s a landmarked building, you don\'t have the option of tearing it down and building new. You have no choice but to renovate. So, what can you do with a building that can\'t be torn down?
